Issue #27
---------

DESIRED CHANGE: 
  1. We need a decorator which can wrap endpoints to assert requesting user has 
     editing/viewing power.
     
TASK LIST:
----------
* DONE Barebones decorator, nothing fancy.
* DONE Create a SecurityException, default to 403?
* DONE Wrap each address endpoint in `authentication_required`
* DONE Re-enable JWT pre-requesting parsing.
* DONE Disable (set `TESTING` = True) JWT for most endpoints. Just leave addresses.
* DONE In JWT pre-request hook, set global claims object.
  If not findable, and URI not in whitelist, throw `SecurityException`.
* DONE Edit decorator to check claims object user ID in URI.
  If not, throw a `SecurityException`.
* DONE Can we test this? I'd prefer to test.
* DONE Record endpoints needing authorization
** TODO Submerchants.
** TODO `transaction` endpoints for generating a token? Preferably? Should we ever generate useful ones?
