Issue #38
---------

DESIRED CHANGE: 
  1. Create a production quality Dockerfile.
     
TASK LIST:
----------
* DONE Create an issue in FE to get FE working w/ nginx in compose stack.
  Make a note that it ought to not bundle the shit into the nginx file, but serve off local disk.
* DONE Install requirements
* DONE Expose external port
* DONE Gunicorn running the application.
* DONE Make Gunicorn run options configurable via ENVVAR
* DONE Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to set up our stack. 
* DONE Postgres DB configurable via ENVVAR
  Insofar as changing user/password, this is already viable due to using postgres' docker image.
* DONE Make braintree configuration configurable via config file
* DONE Get `db` in docker compose to volume on local disk.
  NOTE: It looks like the PG image is already doing this by default, so we can skip
* DONE Backend environment variables to implement
  1. KRONIKL_JWT_KEY
  2. KRONIKL_JWT_EXPIRATION
  3. KRONIKL_BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID
  4. KRONIKL_BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY
  5. KRONIKL_BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY
* DONE Add kronikl-mailer to the necessary things.
  `mix_docker` can be used here. see the shovik.com blog about it.
* DONE Make kronikl-mailer mailgun stuff configurable via envvar.
* DONE Get migrations working.
* DONE Make a migrator image which all the others depend off of. build locally
  This is actually a shitty idea. See following tag.
* DONE Edit entry point bash script to ensure that migrations are ran.
  Seems to be that `exec` in a bash script forces script end?
* DONE Make sure tests are still able to run.
  Some tests may be broke a bit. Need to switch to range types.
* DONE Rerun migrate to see if anything changed.
